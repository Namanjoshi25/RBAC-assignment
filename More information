#Other details
1.For giving admin functinality to a user (only for creating first admin) u need to manually change the user isAdmin property in the database ( to restirct getting admin powers to any users).
2.Admin can manage users by providing then admin power from the admin dashboard.
3.Only admin can create,edit ,delete the blogs.
4.Added a type field for the blogs for better segregations.
